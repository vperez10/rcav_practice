# Our Little Calculator

Our little calculator has an infinite number of resources available for you. The resources all live at URLs according to the following scheme:

 - The square of a particular NUMBER lives at the URL `/square/NUMBER`
 - The square root of a particular NUMBER lives at the URL `/square_root/NUMBER`
 - The size of a monthly loan payment, given an annual interest rate (as a percentage), a total number of payments, and a principal amount, lives at the URL

        /payment/INTEREST_RATE/NUMBER_OF_PAYMENTS/PRINCIPAL_VALUE

Unfortunately, our calculator is not very smart yet and all of these numbers can only be integers. Sorry and thank you!

## Your task: Make all of these URLs work.
